      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Marshall McLuhan’s essay, <em>The Medium is the Message</em>, argues that it’s not the content of media that changes society, but the medium itself. He uses historical examples to show how every new technology reshapes human perception, behavior, and culture. From the printing press to the television, he emphasizes how each medium embeds itself into our daily lives and shifts how we communicate and relate to the world. McLuhan’s big idea is that we often miss how powerful the tools we use are in shaping our experiences—because we’re too focused on what they deliver, instead of what they are.

      <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Reading <em>The Medium is the Message</em> really made me pause and reflect on the world around me. At first, I thought McLuhan was just being abstract, but then it started to click. It’s wild to think that we often obsess over <strong>what</strong> is being said—like the actual message—when it’s the platform that’s shaping how we think and act. It reminded me of how I scroll on TikTok or Instagram and feel totally different compared to when I’m reading a book or watching a film. The vibe isn’t just different because of the content—it’s the platform itself controlling the rhythm, the pace, the format.

        This reading also made me rethink how media influences culture. McLuhan says media doesn’t just deliver content—it <strong>transforms</strong> us. For example, the invention of the printing press didn’t just give us books—it literally changed the way people thought, worked, and communicated. That same shift is happening today with smartphones and AI. We’re adapting in ways we don’t fully understand yet. Even the way we form relationships has changed. It’s like we live through our screens.

        I also really liked the idea that media affects society "silently"—we don’t notice these changes until they’re already part of our lives. This made me more aware of how I use technology and how it shapes my habits, from how I communicate with friends to how I process information. It’s not about blaming tech, but about noticing its impact. Overall, this reading helped me take a step back and look at the bigger picture—how we’re not just <em>using</em> media, we’re being <em>changed</em> by it.
