      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Mozilla Manifesto is all about keeping the internet open, safe, and for everyone. It says the web should be a public space‚Äînot something owned and controlled by big companies. Mozilla believes that people deserve privacy, freedom, and access to information no matter who they are or where they live.</p>
      <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
      <p>I liked that it focused on making the internet a better place for humanity, not just for profit. It made me think more about how much power tech companies have over what we see and share online‚Äîand how important it is to protect our rights as users.</p>

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In this piece, Tim Berners-Lee warns us that the internet isn‚Äôt as safe or open as it used to be. He explains that the web was created to be free and equal for everyone‚Äîbut now, companies and governments are starting to control what we can see and do online. Things like social media sites trapping our data, or internet providers slowing down certain websites, are all threats to that freedom. His message is simple: the web belongs to us, and we all need to protect it.</p>
