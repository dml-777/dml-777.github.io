    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Vannevar Bush’s 1945 essay "As We May Think" predicts many technologies we now use daily, like personal computers, hypertext, and search engines. Bush imagined tools that would extend human memory and knowledge, making information more accessible and boosting scientific progress.

    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      It was fascinating to read how optimistic Bush was about technology right after WWII. Many of his ideas foreshadowed the digital world we live in today. I especially thought about how his vision of the “memex” connects to modern computers and the internet.
