    <h2>Week 03: The Medium is the Message</h2>
    <p><strong>Reading:</strong> Marshall McLuhan, "The Medium is the Message"</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>McLuhan‚Äôs essay explains how the way we communicate matters more than what we‚Äôre communicating. The ‚Äúmedium‚Äù‚Äîwhether it's television, social media, or print‚Äîshapes our behavior, habits, and even society. Each new medium shifts our attention and thinking, regardless of the content it carries. It‚Äôs not the message that changes us‚Äîit‚Äôs the medium itself.</p>

    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
    <p>I never really thought about how technology affects us until I read this. McLuhan makes you realize that we‚Äôre constantly adapting to new platforms without really questioning their impact. Even simple things like texting vs. calling totally change the way we interact. It made me think differently about the tools I use every day.</p>
